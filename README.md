# Climate Change Components

This project houses components, services and models for accessing the Azavea Climate API in an Angular 4+ project.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `yarn run build:library` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `lib-dist/` directory. Use the `npm pack` to produce a tarball that can be installed using `npm install` or published with `npm publish`.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Publishing new versions

Publishing a new version to NPM is handled by Travis CI when tags are pushed to Github.

Make sure to update the version number in `package.json` before creating a new tag.
